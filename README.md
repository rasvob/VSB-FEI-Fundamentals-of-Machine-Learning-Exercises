# 💡 Notes
## How to create a Python Virtual Enviroment named `venv`
```
python -m venv venv
```


Run venv

Use
```
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
in Windows or
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
in Linux


Intall python packages

```
pip install jupyter jupyterlab pandas matplotlib requests seaborn scipy scikit-learn
```


Run Jupyter lab

```
jupyter lab
```
